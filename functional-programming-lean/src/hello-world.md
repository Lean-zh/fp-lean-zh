# Hello, World!

<!--
While Lean has been designed to have a rich interactive environment in which programmers can get quite a lot of feedback from the language without leaving the confines of their favorite text editor, it is also a language in which real programs can be written.
This means that it also has a batch-mode compiler, a build system, a package manager, and all the other tools that are necessary for writing programs.

虽然 Lean 被设计为一个丰富的交互式环境，程序员无需离开他们最喜欢的文本编辑器，
就能从语言中获得相当多的反馈，但它同时也是一门可以编写现实程序的语言。
这意味着它还具有批量编译器、构建系统、包管理器以及编写程序所需的一切工具。

<!--
While the [previous chapter](./getting-to-know.md) presented the basics of functional programming in Lean, this chapter explains how to start a programming project, compile it, and run the result.
Programs that run and interact with their environment (e.g. by reading input from standard input or creating files) are difficult to reconcile with the understanding of computation as the evaluation of mathematical expressions.
In addition to a description of the Lean build tools, this chapter also provides a way to think about functional programs that interact with the world.

[上一章](./getting-to-know.md)介绍了 Lean 函数式编程的基础知识，
本章将解释如何开始一个编程项目、编译它并运行出结果。
运行并与环境交互的程序（例如通过读取标准输入或创建文件）
很难和将计算理解为数学表达式的求值相协调。除了介绍 Lean 构建工具之外，
本章还提供了一种思考函数式程序与世界如何交互的方法。
